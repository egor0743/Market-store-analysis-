# Automotive Fasteners Market Analysis ProjectðŸš—
This project is a comprehensive market analysis for a store specializing in automotive fasteners. The goal was to develop a database that could be used for in-depth market analysis and visualization in Power BI. The project covers several key stages:

Database Design & Implementation:
- Designed and implemented a relational database to store data relevant to the automotive fasteners market.
- Created tables for products, customers, orders, order details, and a calendar for time-based analysis.
- The data was carefully structured to support detailed reporting and analysis.

Data Analysis & Visualization:
- Imported the database into Power BI.
- Developed various reports and dashboards to visualize sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior.

Cloud Deployment:
- The Power BI file, containing all the visualizations and analysis, is hosted in the cloud for easy access and sharing.
- The code and SQL scripts for the database design are available in this repository. You can find the Power BI visualizations [here]().
