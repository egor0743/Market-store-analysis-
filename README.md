# Automotive Fasteners Market Analysis ProjectðŸš—
This project is a comprehensive market analysis for a store specializing in automotive fasteners. The goal was to develop a database that could be used for in-depth market analysis and visualization in Power BI. The project covers several key stages:

Database Design & Implementation:
- Designed and implemented a relational database to store data relevant to the automotive fasteners market.
- Created tables for products, customers, orders, order details, and a calendar for time-based analysis.
- The data was carefully structured to support detailed reporting and analysis.

Data Analysis & Visualization:
- Imported the database into Power BI.
- Developed various reports and dashboards to visualize sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior.

Cloud Deployment:
- The Power BI file, containing all the visualizations and analysis, is hosted in the cloud for easy access and sharing.
- The code and SQL scripts for the database design are available in this repository. To view the Power BI visualizations, download the files from the TestDB-BI folder and open the testDB Power BI file located in the repository.

# Description of the data source ðŸ“‚

This data set includes all transactions for the auto fasteners store in Ukraine. The data covers the period from 01.01.2023 to 31.12.2023 and reflects operations for the sale of assembly products to various customers throughout the country. The data source is the store's own internal records.

# Data modeling process ðŸ”§

I created dimension tables for customers, products, regions, and time to enable efficient querying and data visualization. By establishing relationships between these tables, we can easily navigate and analyze data by different dimensions.
